Narrative
I sign in. I have a profile.
 I enter how many bags I picked up and how many miles I walked. Each bag is worth three points and every mile walked is worth one point.
Once I enter my bags and miles, the app will open my camera and ask me to take a picture of the bags before I throw them away (for accountability).
Once I get 10 points, the app will then ask me if I want to redeem my points now for a small prize or accumulate my points to 30 points for a larger prize. Once I redeem my points (either for 10 or 30), my app shows me a list of prizes I can pick from. There is also a suggestion box at the bottom of the form that allows me to suggest a business where I would like to use my points at (if I use the suggestion box, a message will pop up saying I will get notification of my approved request).
 If I pick a prize that is on the list, I will then be able to use a QR code on my phone to redeem that prize immediately (insta-gift?).  After a participant redeems their 10 or 30 points, their points are reset.
